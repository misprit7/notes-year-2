# Sixth Class
* Maximum power transfer
  * $p=i^2R_L=(\frac{V_{Th}}{R_{Th}+R_L})^2R_L$
  * Want to maximize power transfer
  * Taking derivative of power with respect to $R_L$, get max/min at $R_L=R_{th}$ gives maximum power transfer
* Capacitors
  * Two conductive plates seperated by an insulator
  * Amount of charge stored is directl proportional to the voltage, constant of proportionality is capacitance $C$
  * $q_C(t)=Cv_C(t)$
  * Capacitor stores energy in its electric field
  * $C=\frac{\epsilon A}{d}$
