# First Class
* Charge
	* Electrical property of atomic particles
	* Measured in coulombs
	* In one $C$ ther are $6.24\times 10^{18}$ electron
	* Conservation of charge: charge can neither be created nor destroyed, only transferred
* Types of materials
    * Conductor
        * Electrons can move through easily
    * Insulator
        * Can't conduct
    * Semi-conductor
        * Sometimes act as conductor, sometimes as insulator
        * e.g. doped silicon
* Current
	* Rate of flow of charge accross any cross section of conductor
	* Measured in amperes
	* $i=\frac{dq}{dt}$
	* Originally scientists though was due to positive charge, so direction of current was direction of positive charge
	* In reality, electrons travel in opposite direction of positive current
* Types of current
	* DC remains constant
	* AC varies sinusoidally
	* Many other types of current not as commonly used
* Voltage
	* $V=\frac{dW}{dq}$, $dW=$ change of energy
	* The plus and minus sign are for polarity
	* Assumption is that the potential of the + terminal is higher than -
* Power
	* $p=\frac{dW}{dt}=\frac{dW}{dq}\times\frac{dq}{dt}=vi$
* Tellegan's theorem
	* Principle of Conservation of Power: the algebraic sum of the powers absorbed by all elements in a cricuit is zero at any given time
* Energy calculation
	* Instaneous power: $p(t) = v(t)i(t)$
	* Energy absorbed or supplied by an element from time $t_0$ to time $t>t_0$
		* $W=W(t_0, t) = \int_{t_0}^tp(\tau)d\tau=\int_{t_0}^tv(\tau)i(\tau)d\tau$
* Circuit elements
	* 5 ideal elements
	* Active elements are capable of generating energy
		* Voltage and current sources
    * Passive elements do not generate energy
    	* Resistors, capacitors and inductors
* Ideal voltage and current sources
	* An active element that provides specified voltage or current that is independent of other circuit elements and/or how the source is used in the circuit
* Ideal dependent source
	* Active leement whose voltage/current is controlled by a voltage or current of another circuit element
	* Presented by diamond shaped symbols
	* Four types
		* Voltage controller voltage source (VCVS)
		* Current controlled voltage source (CCVS)
		* Voltage controlled current source (VCCS)
		* Current controlled current source (CCCS)
* Resistance
	* Different materials allow charges to move within them with different levels of ease. This physical property or ability to resist current is known as resistance
	* Resistance of material is inversely proportional to cross section area and directly proportional to length
	* $V=IR$
	* $p=\frac{v^2}{R}=Ri^2$
