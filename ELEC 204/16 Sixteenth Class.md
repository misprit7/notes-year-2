# Sixteenth Class
* Complex power
  * Defined as sum of average power and imaginary reactive power
  * $S=P+jQ$
  * Complex power is in units of volts-amps $VA$
  * Apparent power = $|S|$
  * $\frac QP=\tan(\theta_v-\theta_i)$
* Complex power calculations
  * $S=V_{rms}I_{rms}=\frac12 V I$
* Complex power with impedance
  * $S=Z|I_{eff}|^2$
  * $P=\frac12 I_m^2 R$
  * $Q=\frac12 I_m^2X$
* Maximum power transfer
  * $Z_{th}=R_{th}+jX_{th}$
  * $Z_{L}=R_{L}+jX_{L}$
  * $I=\frac{V_{th}}{(R_{th}+R_L)+j(X_{th}+X_L)}$
  * Trying to maximize $P={I}^2R_L$
  * End up with $Z_L=Z_{th}$ and $P_{max}=\frac12\frac{|V_{th}|^2}{R_{th}}$
* Maximum power transfer if load is restricted
  * Choose $X_L$ as close as possible to $-X_{Th}$
  * Then adjust $R_L$ as close as possible to $\sqrt{R_{th}^2+(X_L-X_C)^2}$
  * The magnitude of $Z_L$ can be changed, however its angle is fixed
