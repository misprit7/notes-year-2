# Ninth Class
* Unit Step function
  * Useful to model circuits with switches
* Step response of first order circuits
  * $\alpha=\frac1\tau$
  * Solution of $\frac{dx(t)}{dt}+ax(t)=F(u(t), x(0^+)=x_0$ is of form 
  * $x(t)=K_1e^{-t/\tau}+F\tau$
  * i.e. $x(t)=(x(0^+)-x(\infty))e^{-t/\tau}+x(\infty)$
