# Second Class
* Resistor codes
	* Bad beer ruins our young generation, but vodka goes well
	* Black brown red orange yellow green blue violet gray white
* Variable resistor
	* Represented by resistor with arrow on it
* Conductance
	* $G=\frac1R$
	* Ability of element to conduct current
	* Measured in siemens (S) or mho (upside down ohm)
* Short and open circuits
	* Zero resistance implies short circuit, zero conductance is open circuit
* Terminology
	* Node: point where two or more circuits elements join
	* Essential node: point where three or more circuit elements join
	* Path: a trace of adjoining basic elements with no elements including more than once
	* Branch: a path that connnects two nodes
	* Essential branch: a path that connects two essential nodes without passing through an essential node
	* Loop: a path whose last node is the same as the starting node
	* Mesh: a loop that does not enclose any other loops
	* Planar circuit: a circuit that can be drawn on a plane with no crossing branches
* Kirchhoff's current law (KCL)
	* Algebraic sum of currents entering a node is zero
* Closed boundary
	* A closed curve or surface such as a circle in a plane that has a well defined inside and outside
	* Sometimes called a supernode
	* Can apply KCL to closed boundary
* Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL)
	* The algebraic sum of the voltage drops around any closed path is zero at any instance
* Series resistors
	* Algebraic sum of resistance
* Parrallel resistors
	* Reciprocal of equivalent resistance is sum of reciprocals of resistances
	* To solve for equivalent resistance apply test voltage or current source
