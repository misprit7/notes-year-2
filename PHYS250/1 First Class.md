# First Class
* Email at mattison@physics.ubc.ca
* Final will be open notes, open book, open web
* First year physics says everything is either a particle or wave
  * This is wrong
  * A wave may be observed by a particle, but can be several places at once
  * Can't know position and velocity exactly
  * Time, length and mass depend on velocity and $F=ma$ is never exact
  * Velocities don't add linearly
* Relativity is only relevant at close to speed of light
  * Photons and particles with zero mass is only possible in relativity
  * Binding energy of protons and neutrons reduce mass by about $1\%$
  * Magnetic fields are due to relativity
  * Maxwell's equations already include relativity
* Quantum mechanics is relevant when wave energy is order of $hf$, where $f$ is the frequency and $h$ is Planck's constant=$6.626\times 10^{-34}$
  * X-rays and gamma rays very obviously quantized
  * Low mass particles have low momentum $p$
  * Atoms are completely quantum-mechanical, so are nuclei
* Waves and mediums
  * Medium is thing wave goes through, e.g. string
  * Wave equation is only true in rest frame of string
    * $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}=\frac1{v^2}\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}$
* Electromagnetic waves
  * Can travel through materials
  * Velocity changes with $n=\frac{V_{medium}}c$
    * $n_{air}=1.0003, n_{water}=1.333$
  * Maxwell's equations are only valid in rest frame of material
* Observer
  * Velocity of wave depends on velocity of observer
  * e.g. stellar aberration
* Early relativity
  * People thought electromagnetic waves travelled through aether
  * Thought there was a drag coefficient
  * Michelson interferometer used to see dragged aether model doesn't work
    * Thought it meant that earth dragged aether completely
  * FitzGerald Lorentz Contraction proposed that moving through aether contracts matter
* Einstein's Postulate
  * Proposed that Maxwell's equations should be valid for all observers, whether stationary or moving
  * Explained Michelson and Morley
  * For Fizeau water telescope, need to add velocity relativistic velocity
  * Explains all problems with aether
* Next time:
  * Read two learning pdfs on Canvas
  * Read chapter 37 1-6
