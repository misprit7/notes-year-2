# First Class
* Syllabus
	* TA: Stephan Retromonaco
	* Howework weekly with Webwork
	* Grades
		* Best of following: 
		* 50% final + 35% midterms + 15% webwork
		* Final - 10%
* FTC
	* $F(x) = \int_{t=0}^x f(t)dt, \frac{dF}{dx} = f$
	* The rate of change of the accumulation of $f$ is $f$ itself
* Multivariable Calculus
	* Functions of two, three (or more) variables $f(x, y)$ or $f(x, y, z)$
* Vector Calculus
	* Vector valued functions of 1 or more variables
	* $A$ vector is a quantity with both magnitude and direction
	* A vector value func of 1 variable $\vec r(t)$ for each $t$, we get a vector
	* Think of $t$ as time and $\vec r(t)$ as the arrow from origin to location of some object moving along some curve
	* Here we think of $\vec r(t)$ as giving a parameterized curve
	* On the other hand, we think of vector valued functions of 2 or 3 variables as vector fields
	* $\vec F(x, y)$ to each point in the plane, we get a vector
	* For example $\vec F(x, y)$ could be the magnitude and direction of the wind
	* Could be the force of gravity or magnetic field
* We will be studying rates of change and notions of acummulation
	* Several notions of derivatives, integration
* Basic 3D coordinates
	* Oriented using the right hand rule
		* wrap hand from x to y axis, z axis pointing upwards
	* Notion of distance in $\mathbb R^3$
		* $D = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}$
    * e.g. $2=\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} \Leftrightarrow 4=x^2+y^2+z^2$ equationg of a sphere in $\mathbb R^3$ of radius 2 centered at the origin
